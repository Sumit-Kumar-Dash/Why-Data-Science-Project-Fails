# E-commerce Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Project

## Overview
This project provides a robust, production-ready solution for predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in the e-commerce domain. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques, domain-specific feature engineering, and business impact analysis to optimize marketing spend, improve customer retention, and drive revenue growth.

## Business Context
- **Domain:** E-commerce & Digital Marketing
- **Problem:** High customer acquisition costs, declining retention, inefficient marketing budget allocation
- **Goals:**
  - Reduce customer acquisition costs by 25%
  - Increase customer retention by 15%
  - Optimize marketing ROI by focusing on high-CLV customers
  - Expected annual revenue impact: $3.2M

## Features
- Synthetic data generation based on real e-commerce KPIs (RFM, demographics, behavior)
- Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with business insights and visualizations
- Advanced feature engineering (RFM scores, engagement, lifecycle, health, velocity)
- Multiple model training and comparison (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression)
- Business impact quantification (ROI, cost savings, retention gains)
- Actionable recommendations for marketing and operations

## Project Structure
- **Predict_Customer_Lifetime_Value.ipynb**: Main notebook containing all code, analysis, and visualizations
- **CLVPredictor class**: Encapsulates data generation, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and business analysis
- **main() function**: Demonstrates end-to-end workflow

## Usage
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```python
   !pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn scikit-learn

2. **Run the notebook:**
- Execute all cells in order for a complete demonstration
- Visualizations and business insights are generated automatically
  
3. **Customize parameters:**
- Adjust n_customers in data generation for different dataset sizes
- Modify business assumptions in the business_impact_analysis method as needed

## Key Outputs
CLV distribution and segmentation
Feature importance for CLV prediction
Model performance metrics (RÂ², RMSE, MAE)
Quantified business impact and ROI
Actionable recommendations for marketing and retention

## Professional Practices
- Clean code architecture and documentation
- Domain expertise in e-commerce metrics
- Business-focused approach with stakeholder-ready outputs
- Scalable and extensible for real-world production use
